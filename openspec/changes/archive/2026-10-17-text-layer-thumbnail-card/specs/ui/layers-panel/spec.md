## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Layer row badges and delegate

The system SHALL draw each row with a delegate that paints, in CS6 order, the
visibility toggle, the thumbnail (a folder glyph for a group), the name, a
clipping-mask indicator for a clipped layer, the clipping indentation and base
underline, the layer-mask thumbnail when a mask is present, an adjustment badge
when adjustment content is present, a layer-style `fx` badge when the layer
carries a layer style (an `lfx2` or legacy `lrFX` block), and a compact
**`Blend If` text chip** when the layer's advanced blending is customised — a
non-default `Blend If` view, or a raw `blending_ranges` block present without a
typed view. The chip SHALL be a text-only badge (no icon asset) drawn in the
row's right-edge badge run left of the `fx` and lock badges, and its advance
SHALL be reserved by the same right-edge walk that lays out the mask thumbnails
and the name rect so nothing overlaps. A layer whose lock
state has any flag set SHALL also show a lock badge at the right side of its
row, except that the Transparency and Image locks a type or shape layer is
forced to carry SHALL NOT by themselves show one (CS6 shows them only in the
Lock strip); an unlocked layer SHALL show none. The visibility toggle SHALL be an eye
icon (`layers.eyeOn`/`layers.eyeOff`) drawn slightly inset from the panel's left
edge and at the same x for every row, independent of nesting depth; the nesting
indentation SHALL apply to the thumbnail and name, not to the visibility toggle.
A layer whose color label is not `None` SHALL tint the **visibility toggle's own
background** (`eyeRect`) with that label color behind the eye glyph, and SHALL
additionally paint a small color-label **chip** — a short bar of the label
color, one row tall — at the start of the row content immediately before the
thumbnail, with the thumbnail and name laid out after the chip so no rect
overlaps; the tint SHALL keep the eye glyph and any selection highlight legible,
and the label color elsewhere on the row SHALL fall back to the row background.
The chip is a paint-only affordance and SHALL NOT alter hit-testing beyond the
thumbnail and name rects accounting for it. A group with at least one child
SHALL show a disclosure icon — right when collapsed, down when expanded — at its
indented position, and clicking that icon SHALL expand or collapse the group. A
**regular (non-group) layer's thumbnail SHALL be drawn over a cached two-tone
checkerboard** so transparency reads under it, while a group keeps its folder
glyph and no checkerboard. A **type layer's thumbnail SHALL be drawn as a
square (1:1) white card bearing a "T"**, sized to the thumbnail's side and
centred in its slot, regardless of the document's aspect ratio; it SHALL NOT be
letterboxed to the document, and its hit rectangle SHALL be that square card.
Every other non-group layer's thumbnail SHALL be laid out in a box `thumb` wide
and the row's full height minus a small pad, and SHALL be letterboxed to the
document's aspect ratio inside that box, so a tall document's thumbnail fills the
row vertically rather than floating in a square box. **Every non-group thumbnail
other than a type layer's SHALL carry a 1 px black outline**; a type layer's
card and a group's folder glyph SHALL draw no outline, and **when exactly one
layer is active** (the same singular
active-layer resolution tool edits use) its thumbnail SHALL additionally show
white 1 px corner brackets drawn one pixel outside the thumbnail card (for a
regular layer, outside the outline); with zero or
multiple active layers no brackets are drawn. A layer whose row reports the
smart-object projection SHALL paint the `layers.kindSmartObject` badge on the
thumbnail's lower-right corner, whether the smart object is embedded or
placed/external; the badge SHALL be omitted when the asset is missing. Row
typography SHALL derive from the layer: a `background` layer's name SHALL be
italic/cursive, every other name normal, and a layer that is a member of the
frame's link set or a placed/external smart object SHALL be underlined through
the `LayerRowLinkedRole` and `LayerRowPlacedRole` projections. The delegate SHALL
report a row height of at least **28 px** through one named constant used by both
`sizeHint` and the vertical centring math. If an expected icon asset is
unavailable, the delegate SHALL omit that badge while keeping the row legible
rather than fail.

#### Scenario: The visibility toggle is an eye icon [lpr_eye]

- **WHEN** a layer row is shown
- **THEN** its visibility toggle is drawn from the eye icon asset, and a hidden
  layer uses the off variant

#### Scenario: The eye is left-anchored for every depth [lpr_eye]

- **WHEN** a nested layer is shown under its group
- **THEN** its eye icon is at the same x as a top-level row's, while its
  thumbnail and name are indented

#### Scenario: The color label tints only the eye toggle [lpr_label_tint]

- **WHEN** a layer with a non-`None` color label is shown
- **THEN** the eye toggle's background is filled with that label color behind
  the eye glyph and a chip of the same color is painted at the row content edge
  before the thumbnail, and the rest of the row background is unchanged

#### Scenario: The label chip sits before the thumbnail [lpr_label_chip]

- **WHEN** a labeled row is shown
- **THEN** the chip is drawn between the disclosure/clipping glyph and the
  thumbnail, and the thumbnail's left edge follows the chip so the two do not
  overlap

#### Scenario: An unlabeled layer has no gutter tint [lpr_label_tint_none]

- **WHEN** a layer with color label `None` is shown
- **THEN** its eye gutter uses the normal row background and no chip is painted

#### Scenario: A smart object shows the badge [lpr_smart_badge]

- **WHEN** an embedded or placed smart-object layer is shown
- **THEN** its thumbnail draws the smart-object badge on the lower-right corner

#### Scenario: A non-smart layer shows no smart badge [lpr_smart_badge_absent]

- **WHEN** an ordinary pixel layer is shown
- **THEN** no smart-object badge is drawn on its thumbnail

#### Scenario: A group shows a disclosure icon [lpr_chevron]

- **WHEN** a group with children is shown collapsed and then expanded
- **THEN** it shows the right-pointing icon when collapsed and the down-pointing
  icon when expanded, and clicking the icon toggles it

#### Scenario: A masked layer shows a mask thumbnail [m39_badges]

- **WHEN** a layer carries a layer mask
- **THEN** its row shows a mask thumbnail and the mask-presence flag is set

#### Scenario: A clipped layer shows the clipping indicator [lpc_clip]

- **WHEN** a layer is clipped to the layer below it
- **THEN** its row draws the clipping-mask indicator in addition to the
  indentation and the base layer's underline

#### Scenario: A group row is expandable [m39_badges]

- **WHEN** a group has children
- **THEN** its row is marked expandable and shows an expand/collapse control

#### Scenario: A locked layer shows a right-side lock badge [lpc_lockbadge]

- **WHEN** a layer has any lock flag set
- **THEN** its row draws a lock badge on the right side, and an unlocked layer
  draws no lock badge

#### Scenario: A type layer's forced locks show no badge [lpc_forced_lock_badge]

- **WHEN** `tst_type_tools::typeLayerRowHasNoLockBadge` commits a type layer, then also locks its position
- **THEN** the layer carries the Transparency and Image locks and its row has no lock badge; with Position locked too the badge shows

#### Scenario: A regular thumbnail shows a checkerboard [lpr_thumb_checker]

- **WHEN** a regular (non-group) layer with translucent pixels is shown
- **THEN** its thumbnail is drawn over a two-tone checkerboard, while a group
  row keeps its folder glyph and draws no checkerboard

#### Scenario: Thumbnails are outlined and the active layer is bracketed [lpr_thumb_bracket]

- **WHEN** a regular layer row is shown with a 1 px black thumbnail outline
- **THEN** the singular active layer's thumbnail additionally shows white
  corner brackets one pixel outside the outline, and a multi- or zero-selection
  row shows no brackets

#### Scenario: A group icon has no outline [lpr_group_no_outline]

- **WHEN** a group row is shown
- **THEN** its folder glyph carries no 1 px black outline, while a regular
  layer's thumbnail keeps its outline

#### Scenario: A type card is square with no outline [lpr_type_thumb_card]

- **WHEN** a type layer row is shown in a document of any aspect ratio
- **THEN** its thumbnail is a square white card with a "T" whose width equals
  its height, it is not letterboxed to the document, it carries no 1 px black
  outline, and the thumbnail's hit rectangle is that same square card

#### Scenario: A tall thumbnail fills the row [lpr_thumb_fill]

- **WHEN** a portrait document's layer row is shown
- **THEN** its letterboxed thumbnail is taller than it is wide and spans the
  row's full height minus the thumbnail pad

#### Scenario: Row typography follows the layer kind [lpr_row_fonts]

- **WHEN** the rows for the Background, a linked layer, and a placed smart
  object are inspected
- **THEN** the Background name is italic/cursive, ordinary names are normal, and
  the linked and placed rows are underlined through their roles

#### Scenario: The row height has a floor [lpr_row_height]

- **WHEN** a row's size hint is read
- **THEN** its height is at least 28 px from the single named row-height
  constant

#### Scenario: A missing badge asset does not break the row [m39_badges]

- **WHEN** the adjustment badge's icon asset is missing
- **THEN** the row is still drawn and the badge is simply omitted

#### Scenario: A styled layer shows the fx badge

- **WHEN** a layer that carries a layer style is shown
- **THEN** its row draws the `layers.fx` badge at its right edge beside the lock
  and mask badges, and a layer with no style draws no fx badge

#### Scenario: A customised Blend If shows the badge [lpr_blendif_badge]

- **WHEN** a layer whose advanced blending is customised (its Blend If view is
  not the full `(0, 65535)` default, or a raw `blending_ranges` block is
  present without a typed view) is shown
- **THEN** its row draws a compact `Blend If` text chip in the right-edge badge
  run, and the name elides before the chip so no rect overlaps

#### Scenario: A default Blend If shows no badge [lpr_blendif_badge_absent]

- **WHEN** a layer with no Blend If view and no `blending_ranges` block, or one
  whose every range is the full default, is shown
- **THEN** no `Blend If` chip is drawn on its row and the name keeps the full
  right-edge run

#### Scenario: A raw blending-ranges block without a typed view still badges [lpr_blendif_raw]

- **WHEN** a layer carries a non-empty `blending_ranges` block that cannot be
  parsed into a typed Blend If view
- **THEN** its row still draws the `Blend If` chip

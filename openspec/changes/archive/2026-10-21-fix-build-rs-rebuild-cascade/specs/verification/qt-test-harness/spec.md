# Spec Delta

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: The Qt Test layer's critical path is not a single suite

The Qt Test layer SHALL be split so that the CTest run's critical path is not
one suite: the suites that determine the layer's wall time SHALL number at
least two, so the layer's duration is set by the number of suites and the
parallel level rather than by one slow suite. A suite that is inherently long
SHALL be split into additional registered entries, and the CTest parallel
level SHALL remain overridable through `CTEST_PARALLEL_LEVEL`.

#### Scenario: the critical path names more than one suite [qth_critical_path]

- **WHEN** the CTest run finishes and prints its critical path
- **THEN** the critical path names at least two suites

#### Scenario: no suite is reported as timed out [qth_suite_timeout]

- **WHEN** the CTest run finishes
- **THEN** no suite is reported as timed out
